/* Standard syscall interface is as follows:


	arg0 (The first IPC argument) is the syscall number
	arg1-arg4 are all standard integers/pointers

	ret0 is the error code dependent on the syscall, however 0 must == SUCCESS,
   and >0 is a FAILURE
	ret1-ret3 are the return values from the syscall dependent on the syscall
